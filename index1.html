Spamton.inc is responsible for any I'm Michael Jordan, 
McDonalds restaurants have given me this time to talk about 
something we both really care about. Kids. Kids are the reason 
McDonalds sponsors the "Get it straight" program, a national drug 
awareness effort. Think about this, many of you using drugs out there 
now, are under 18. Do you realize that at 18 you have lived only 1/4 of 
your life? When using drugs, you're only cheating yourself out of the 
chance to find out who you really can be, and believe me, if you don't use 
drugs, you can be just about anything you think you can be. Listen, you got 
atleast 3/4 of your life to go, that's three more lifetimes to you, so don't 
blow it, don't do drugs, if you're doing it, stop it, get some help. McDonalds
wants you to get youself a chance, a chance to find out all the wonderful 
things you really can be. And so do I.
