Update: Some weird <a href="update.html" style="color:red">puppet looking guy
</a> Is offering to buy my domain for his... "shap"? I have no idea. Also, the currency
he asked for was "kromer". I looked it up and it doesn't seem to be an southwest New Yorker
slang like he said. I pretty sure its a scam, however he did a big number...

Update 2: The lettew "w" bwoke on my keyboawd, and it now displays "w" instead.
Now I have this uwu language when typing. Help I don't wanna be bullied for this.
Anyone have any pc wepaiw shops weccomdations?
